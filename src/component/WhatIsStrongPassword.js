                        A strong password is one that is difficult for others to guess or crack. It should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-700 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                        Beyond complexity, a strong password should also be unique and not reused across multiple accounts. Regularly updating your passwords and checking if theyâ€™ve been exposed in data breaches are also key to maintaining strong security.
